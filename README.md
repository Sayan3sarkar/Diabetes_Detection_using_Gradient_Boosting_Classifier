# Diabetes_Detection_using_Gradient_Boosting_Classifier

**Diabetes** is a disease that occurs when your [blood glucose](https://diabeteswa.com.au/manage-your-diabetes/monitoring-blood-glucose/what-is-blood-glucose/), also called **blood sugar**, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. [Insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin), a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough or any insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.

In the U.S, every 1 out of 7 people suffer from **Diabetes**, and it is becoming an increasing problem.

The Objective of this project is to prepare a Machine Learning Model using [Gradient Boosting Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html) on [diabetes.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/saurabh00007/diabetescsv)to detect whether a patient has diabetes or not.
